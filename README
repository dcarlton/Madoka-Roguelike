# Madoka-Roguelike
An unfinished prototype of a roguelike-esque game based on the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica, using Pygame. The playable characters and some basic enemies are implemented, and work was started on human NPCs to be rescued, but more complex enemies, other major characters appearing as NPCs, and any kind of a clear interface were not finished. Originally started for fun and practice, only the vaguest high-level ideas of an architecture was thrown together without much thought. Because of this, the code is very poorly-structured, and frustrations with the codebase caused me to abandon this project.
